# About
This is a web application for booking fictional tickets for movies without leaving your home. The future is now!
- Sort through a collection of movies
- Choose the best day and session for you
- Book as many seats as you want, bring everyone!
- Get a summary of your booking at the end
- Do it again!

All tickets and sessions are fictional, this is just an educational project for me to test my React skills :)
